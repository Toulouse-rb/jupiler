h2. History

This library is based on code under MIT licence originally written for IIIaquarii a rails based github / gitosis clone.

Before starting this project we dissected Gitauth, to extract its very essence. We then decided to start from scratch on our own, tossing everything and starting from a clean slate. So it probably looks similar to GithAuth, or Gitosis, since these projects are pretty much the state-of-the-art.
